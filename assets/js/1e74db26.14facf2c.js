In this race, to mine the next block, the participants -- most commonly referred to as miners -- gather as many open transactions as they can into a new block body and calculate the Merkle Root from that, and they calculate other information for their new block header as well, all except the 4-byte nonce we mentioned above."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"The miner can set this nonce to any value they like, but the goal in doing so is to make the hash of the block header meet the target difficulty.

At current difficulty, approximately 1 in every 75,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible headers will produce a hash with enough leading zeros to be valid.

Unfortunately for miners, many crypto protocols reduce the size of the block reward over time. But there is another way miners can still get paid.

The target difficulty of mining blocks is designed to force new blocks to be mined at a relatively constant rate.
